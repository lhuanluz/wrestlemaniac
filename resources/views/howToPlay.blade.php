                <p>
                    Wrestlemaniac is a wrestling fantasy game inspired on the main WWE shows: Smackdown Live and Monday Night Raw.
                    <br><br>
                    In Wrestlemaniac you become the manager and advocate of a team of superstars. With your initial amout of game money, your mission is to hire the superstars you believe in to be part of your selected team.

                <h3>2 - Team completed. Time to be ringside!</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    Once your team is complete, it’s time to prepare to be ringside just as all great supertstars advocates do in WWE shows!
                    <br><br>
                    During the Smackdown and Raw shows, your selected superstars may performe angles, win or lose matches, and depending on their performance they can score more or less points for you.
                    <br><br>
                    The better is the superstar performance on the show, the higher will be the score that superstar will make for you!  
                    <br><br>
                    And there’s one more thing to be aware of.
                    <br><br>
                    The price to hire a superstar totally depends on his or her score on the shows. If they did well, their score will influence positively their appreciation, what will make their contract price go high.
                    <br><br>
                    But be careful, the oposite is also true. Yeah, it’s dammmn true!

                <p>
                    Thinking about that ups and downs in the performance of a superstars we decided to handle the contracts in a way that benefits both of us, advocates and superstars. 
                    <br><br>
                    So are you dissatisfied with the performance of a superstars and want to give another superstar na opportunity?
