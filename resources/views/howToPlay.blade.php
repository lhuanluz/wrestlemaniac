            </div>
            <div class="description">
                <p>
                    Once your team is complete, it’s time to prepare to be at ringside just as all great supertstars managers do in WWE shows!
                    <br><br>
                    During the Raw and Smackdown shows, your selected superstars may performe angles, win or lose matches, and depending on their performance they can score more or less points for you.
                    <br><br>
                    The better is the superstar performance on the show, the higher will be the score that this superstar will make for you!  
                    <br><br>
                    And there’s one more thing to be aware of.
                    <br><br>
                    The price to hire a superstar totally depends on his or her score on the shows. If they did well, their score will influence positively their appreciation, what will make their contract price go sky high.
                    <br><br>
                    But be careful, the oposite is also true. Yeah, it’s dammmn true!
